# Gradient Descent and Regression Techniques

## Quick Summary 
The primary aim of this project is to implement the gradient descent optimization algorithm from scratch, and use it to minimise the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of both linear regression and multivariate regression models. To verify the accuracy of these self-defined functions, we compare our results to those obtained using regression models from standard libraries. 

In addition, we explore important concepts such as regularization (e.g. in models such as LASSO, ridge regression), overfitting and standardization.
