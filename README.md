# Gradient Descent and Regression Techniques

## Quick Summary 
The primary aim of this project is to implement the gradient descent optimization algorithm from scratch, and use it to minimise the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of both linear regression and multivariate regression models. As before, we consider the Boston Housing Dataset for this project. To verify the accuracy of these self-defined functions, we compare our results to those obtained using regression models from standard libraries. In addition, we explore how important concepts such as regularization (e.g. in models such as LASSO, ridge regression) and standardization affect the predictive performance of models.
